The India Gate, also known as the All India War Memorial, stands as a solemn tribute to the valor and sacrifice of 74,187 Indian soldiers who lost their lives during World War I (1914–1921) and the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, this monumental sandstone arch graces the eastern end of Rajpath in New Delhi
Its architectural style evokes ancient Roman triumphal arches, reminiscent of the Arch of Constantine in Rome and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The India Gate is adorned with 13,313 engraved names, including those of Indian servicemen and officers from the United Kingdom1.

Beneath the archway, you’ll find the Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), a black marble structure with a reversed rifle, a war helmet, and four eternal flames. Since 1971, it has served as India’s tomb of the unknown soldier, symbolizing the nation’s enduring respect for its fallen heroes. Every Republic Day, the Prime Minister pays tribute to the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate, marking a poignant moment in our history
